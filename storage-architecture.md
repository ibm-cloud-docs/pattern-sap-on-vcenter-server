| Architecture decision | Requirement | Decision | Rationale |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Primary storage           | Primary file storage for vCenter Server  | Use a mix of Input-Output Operations per second (IOPS) Network File Storage (NFS) for production workloads and reduce cost storage when high IOPS are not required | vSAN is not certified for SAP workloads \n Cost and performance optimization                                                                               |
